# ** Tips to translate **
# May use http://essiembre.github.io/eclipse-rbe/ as editor, makes it a lot easyer
# Use a dot (.) to group tags by Category, this is common in property files, and then
# it's displayed as groups in the Translator plugin mentioned above
#
# See jsettlers.dev.helper.translation.ConvertPropertiesToStandardEncoding and ConvertPropertiesToUtf8
# To convert the encoding, the Translation editor is only working with standard encoding
