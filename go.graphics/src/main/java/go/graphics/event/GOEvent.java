/**
 * This class defines a generic go event type.
 * <p>
 * When you are notified that an event started, you may handle the event by calling the setHandler-Method of the event. If the handler you gave the
 * event is accepted, event changes are forwarded to you. If your implementation does not allow multiple events at the same time, you should not set a
 * handler to an event if you already handle an ongoing event.
 * <p>
 * if your event handler methods. need to be synchronized, you have to care for it yourself.
 * <p>
 * After its initialization the event, changes of the event state are passed on to the handler: On a phase change, the
 * {@link GOEventHandler#phaseChanged(GOEvent)} method is called. During the Modal phase, the event may send additional information about the possible
 * event data it may have upon finish, e.g. a mouse position change to an {@link GOModalEventHandler}.
 * <p>
 * Any final action should only be applied if the event was finished.
